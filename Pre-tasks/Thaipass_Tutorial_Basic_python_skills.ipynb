    "### Using a jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is a browser based python package that allows for cell based coding.\n",
    "Jupyter notebook can edit most text based files, but is designed to run `.ipynb` files, such as this one.\n",
    "This can all be easliy done within the dashboard of the program.\n",
    "The code uses a kernel as its computational engine, storing memory and processing tasks.\n",
    "The kernal will store any functions, variables and previous code that has been ran.\n",
    "The kernel can be reset by going into Kernal -> Restart & Clear Outputs.\n",
    "If your code eeds to be stoped, for example if it is taking too long for a task, the kernel can be interupted by using the stop button ($\\Box$) above the work area.\n",
    "In order to run a cell with code in you simply have to shift+enter when interacting with the desired cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "The skills covered here are:\n",

    "#### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important skills to familiarise yourself with is debugging your code.\n",
    "When your code does not function it will generate an error message based on the issue it ran into.\n",
    "Take the time to identify where you code is going wrong and attempt to fix it.\n",
    "If the error message seems vague you may want to experiment with your code by changing variables and adding outputs to examine your code at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "#### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end and throughout of this notebook you will find some basic tasks to test your skills with basic python. As python is an ever expanding platform many of the tasks can likely be done by external scripts, but in order to test yourself we ask that you use only the skills shown in this notebook."

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Importing\n",
    "We begin with importing modules from the inbuilt python install. \n",
    "We can import directly form the name of the module, or call a module from within another. \n",
    "These modules can be renamed in order to reduce retyping long module names.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Commenting\n",
    "Lines that begin with a `#` are comments, these are ignored by the script and are used to take notes and explain the functionality of the code.\n",
    "Comments can also be used to cause sections of your code to be ignored when the cell is ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Print statements\n",
    "Print statements output a string onto the screen. Within a notebook it will output the string below the cell it is ran from.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic python function\n",
    "Simple and advanced mathematics can be performed by python. These use the standard mathematical opertors of `+`, `-`, `*`(mutiplication), `/`(division), `**`(indexing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will follow standard mathematical rules, initially performing any math in parentheses, performing any indexing, any multiplication or division and finally any addition or subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values are often placed into variables. These variable will maintain the memory of any actions aligned with them, can can be called in future calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data classes/types\n",
    "The data that you will create can come in many forms. The core three types are Integer, Float and String.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer (`int` in `type()` outputs) value consists of only a whole number, with no decimal point. They can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Float (`float` in `type()` outputs) values are numbers with a decimal point in them, these are the values you will likely use most for this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings (`str` in `type()` outputs) are simply unicode characters in a list, this can be used to create words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data types can be identified by using the `type(x)` command, where x is your variable/value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of data interact in specific ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Arrays & Lists\n",
    "Arrays and lists can be used to collect data. Arrays are created using number python and lists are inbuilt to python.\n",
    "In order to create an array the `numpy.array()` command must be used.\n",
    "Arrays and lists may seem to be identical but they interact with each other and basic mathematical funtions differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data structure\n",
    "Lists and arrays can be used to call specific values called indexing. This can be perfomed by placing a number in square brackets after a list. Using a colon we can slice the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some python code requires indenting to identify where that function is working over. These functions include loops and if statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many python values can be interacted with using objects, there are simple objects that allow for quick coding and more complex objects that can skip large blocks of manual code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Boolean satements\n",
    "A type of class a variable can be is a boolean value (`bool` in `type()` outputs).\n",
    "Boolean values can be used to define if statement conditions, by either calling a True or False value or using \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simple loops\n",
    "There are two simple looping techniques: for statements and while statements.\n",
    "For statements produce a loop based on predetermined inputs, such as 1 to 10.\n",
    "While loops will continue to loop as long as the boolean operator is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Input\n",
    "Python can ask the user to input their own values, which can be stored in a variable, allowin for direct user interaction without having to open the code to alter the output.\n",
