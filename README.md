# ThaiPASS2019

This directory contains all the material that we will use during the ThaiPASS school.

Each of the first 4 days of the summer school are assigned to a different folder. These are as follows:

## DAY1: Introduction. 
In the notebooks and solutions section the tasks and data for the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and Kepler's laws of motion notebooks are included, along with solutions. Brief lecture notes are also included.

## DAY2: Nuclear Astrophysics
A guide to the use of the AstroHub (University of Victoria) initiative is included here, along with tasks and the lecture notes for stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. These are most easily completed using the AstroHub infrastructure

## DAY3
Full description, with brief lecture notes, of the Forward Euler Method. Model ansers are included for this task.

## DAY4
Lecture notes and tasks covering dark matter, rotation curves of galaxies and the effect of supernovae on galactic dynamics.

Days 1 and 3 are more code-orientated, days 2 and 4 are more knowlede focussed, however all 4 days require students to develop their python skills.

## Pre-Tasks
Problems and solutions for mandatory work pre-attendance. Contains the Basic and Advanced notebooks.

## DATA_FOR_TASKS
Data for the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram task
